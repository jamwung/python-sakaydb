Welcome to the SakayDB repository, a project developed as part of the Programming in Data Science course. Our goal was to create a Python module named SakayDB specifically designed for managing ride-hailing data.

## Overview

SakayDB is a data management tool implemented using Python's standard libraries along with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This module allows users to efficiently process, analyze, and visualize ride-hailing data, making it a valuable resource for anyone working with transportation data or interested in data science.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** SakayDB simplifies the process of handling ride-hailing data, including data import, cleaning, and transformation.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Utilize the power of Pandas and NumPy for in-depth statistical analysis of ride-hailing data, enabling insights and informed decision-making.

- **Data Visualization:** Visualize trends, patterns, and key metrics using Matplotlib, making it easier to communicate your findings to stakeholders.

## Getting Started

To start using SakayDB, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

3. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```shell
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
